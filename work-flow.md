This program is a Python script that uses the LangChain library to create a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model. RAG models combine a language model with a retrieval system to provide more relevant and factual responses to queries by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base.
Here's a breakdown of the code:

Imports: The script imports the necessary libraries and modules, such as PromptTemplate and CTransformers from LangChain, Chroma for the vector store, HuggingFaceBgeEmbeddings for embeddings, and gradio for creating a user interface.
Configuration: The script sets up the configuration for the language model (local_llm) and defines parameters like max_new_tokens, repetition_penalty, temperature, top_k, top_p, stream, and threads.
Language Model Initialization: The script initializes the language model using CTransformers from LangChain and the specified configuration.
Prompt Template: A prompt template is defined to format the context (retrieved information) and the user's question for the language model.
Embeddings: The script sets up the embeddings using HuggingFaceBgeEmbeddings from the langchain_community library. Embeddings are used to convert the text data into vector representations for efficient retrieval.
Vector Store: A Chroma vector store is loaded or created to store the embeddings and the corresponding text data.
Retriever: The vector store is converted into a retriever using as_retriever method, which will be used to retrieve relevant information from the knowledge base.
Sample Prompts: A list of sample prompts is provided for testing purposes.
Gradio Interface: The script uses Gradio to create a user interface with a text input field for entering prompts.
Response Generation: The get_response function is defined, which takes the user's input prompt, sets up the RetrievalQA chain from LangChain, retrieves relevant information from the knowledge base using the retriever, and generates a response using the language model.
Utility Functions: The script includes utility functions for calculating the time difference between the start and end of the response generation process (calculate_time_difference) and parsing the JSON response from the language model (parse_json).
Gradio Interface Launch: Finally, the script launches the Gradio interface, allowing users to enter prompts and receive responses from the RAG model.

This program demonstrates how to combine a language model with a retrieval system using LangChain to create a question-answering application. The knowledge base used in this example is related to pet care, specifically for dogs. However, the program can be adapted to work with different knowledge bases and domains by modifying the data used for the vector store.

The configuration parameters used in the config dictionary are specific to the CTransformers language model from LangChain. These parameters control various aspects of the model's behavior and output generation. Here's an explanation of each parameter:

max_new_tokens (default: 1024): This parameter sets the maximum number of tokens (words or subwords) that the model can generate in its output. It helps to limit the length of the generated text and prevent the model from producing unnecessarily long responses.
repetition_penalty (default: 1.1): This parameter controls the extent to which the model avoids repeating the same words or phrases in its output. A higher value discourages repetition, while a lower value allows for more repetition. Setting a value higher than 1.0 can help produce more diverse and coherent responses.
temperature (default: 0.1): The temperature parameter controls the randomness or "creativity" of the model's output. A higher temperature (e.g., 0.8 or higher) will make the output more diverse and unpredictable, while a lower temperature (e.g., 0.1 or lower) will make the output more deterministic and focused on the most likely options.
top_k (default: 50): This parameter determines the number of tokens with the highest probability that the model will consider for generating the next token. A lower value will make the output more deterministic, while a higher value will make it more diverse.
top_p (default: 0.9): This parameter is an alternative to top_k and controls the cumulative probability mass of tokens to consider for generating the next token. A value of 0.9 means that the model will consider the most probable tokens until their cumulative probability reaches 0.9 and discard the remaining tokens.
stream (default: True): This parameter specifies whether the model should generate its output in a streaming fashion (i.e., token by token) or generate the entire output at once.
threads (default: int(os.cpu_count() / 2)): This parameter determines the number of parallel threads to use for generating the output. It is set to half of the available CPU cores, which can help improve performance on multi-core systems.

These parameters are crucial for controlling the behavior of the language model and fine-tuning its output to suit the specific needs of your application. For example, if you want more focused and deterministic responses, you might use a lower temperature and higher repetition_penalty. If you want more diverse and creative responses, you might increase the temperature and adjust the top_k or top_p values.
It's important to note that the optimal values for these parameters can vary depending on the specific language model, the task at hand, and the desired output characteristics. Experimentation and fine-tuning may be necessary to find the best configuration for your use case.

This line of code initializes an instance of the CTransformers language model from the LangChain library.
Let's break it down:
pythonCopy codellm = CTransformers(
    model=local_llm,
    model_type="mistral",
    # lib="avx2",  # for CPU use
    **config
)

llm = CTransformers(...): This creates an instance of the CTransformers class and assigns it to the variable llm. CTransformers is a language model wrapper provided by LangChain that allows you to use various pre-trained language models, including those from Anthropic.
model=local_llm: This parameter specifies the pre-trained language model to be used. In this case, local_llm is a variable that holds the path or identifier of the pre-trained model. It is set to "mistral-7b-openorca.gguf2.Q4_0.gguf" earlier in the code.
model_type="mistral": This parameter indicates the type or architecture of the pre-trained model being used. In this case, it is set to "mistral", which is the name of the model family from Anthropic.
# lib="avx2"  # for CPU use: This is a commented-out line, which means it is not executed. If uncommented, it would specify the CPU instruction set to be used for running the model on a CPU. The "avx2" value stands for the "Advanced Vector Extensions 2" instruction set, which is commonly supported by modern CPUs.
**config: This is a way to unpack the config dictionary, which contains various configuration parameters for the language model. The ** operator allows you to pass the key-value pairs of the dictionary as separate keyword arguments to the CTransformers constructor.

The config dictionary is defined earlier in the code and contains parameters like max_new_tokens, repetition_penalty, temperature, top_k, top_p, stream, and threads. These parameters control various aspects of the language model's behavior, such as the maximum output length, repetition penalty, randomness, and parallelization.
By passing **config to the CTransformers constructor, each key-value pair in the config dictionary is treated as a separate keyword argument. For example, max_new_tokens=1024 would be passed as a keyword argument to the constructor.
In summary, this line of code initializes an instance of the CTransformers language model wrapper from LangChain, using the pre-trained "mistral-7b-openorca" model from Anthropic, and applies the specified configuration parameters from the config dictionary.

The prompt_template is a string that defines the structure of the prompt that will be used to provide context and the question to the language model. It uses Python's formatted string literals (f-strings) to incorporate the context and question variables.
Here's the prompt_template:
pythonCopy codeprompt_template = """Use the following pieces of information to answer the user's question.
If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Context: {context}
Question: {question}

Only return the helpful answer below and nothing else.
Helpful answer:
"""
Let's break it down:

Instruction: The first line provides an instruction to the language model to use the provided context to answer the user's question.
Handling unknown answers: The second line instructs the language model to say that it doesn't know the answer if it can't find a relevant answer in the context, instead of making up an answer.
Context placeholder: {context} is a placeholder that will be replaced with the actual context information retrieved from the knowledge base.
Question placeholder: {question} is a placeholder that will be replaced with the user's question or prompt.
Output instruction: The next line instructs the language model to only return the helpful answer and nothing else.
Answer prompt: The final line "Helpful answer:" serves as a prompt for the language model to begin generating the answer.

When the PromptTemplate is instantiated with this template string, it creates a template object that can be called with the context and question values.
pythonCopy codeprompt = PromptTemplate(template=prompt_template, input_variables=['context', 'question'])
Later in the code, when the RetrievalQA chain is created, the prompt object is used to format the context and question for the language model:
pythonCopy codeqa = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=llm,
    chain_type="stuff",
    retriever=retriever,
    return_source_documents=True,
    chain_type_kwargs={"prompt": prompt},
    verbose=True
)
The context is the relevant information retrieved from the knowledge base (in this case, the Chroma vector store) based on the user's question. The prompt template is used to combine the context and question into a formatted prompt that the language model can understand and generate an answer from.
By using this prompt template, the language model is provided with the necessary context and question, along with instructions on how to use the context to answer the question and handle cases where it doesn't have enough information to provide a helpful answer.

The 'context' is set by retrieving relevant information from the knowledge base (vector store) based on the user's question or prompt.
In this code, the context is retrieved using the Chroma vector store and the retriever object, which is created from the vector store using as_retriever method:
pythonCopy codeload_vector_store = Chroma(persist_directory="stores/pet_cosine", embedding_function=embeddings)
retriever = load_vector_store.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 1})
When the RetrievalQA chain is created, the retriever object is passed as an argument:
pythonCopy codeqa = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=llm,
    chain_type="stuff",
    retriever=retriever,
    return_source_documents=True,
    chain_type_kwargs={"prompt": prompt},
    verbose=True
)
When the qa object is called with a user's question or prompt, it performs the following steps:

The user's question is embedded into a vector representation using the specified embedding function (HuggingFaceBgeEmbeddings in this case).
The retriever uses this vector representation to search for the most similar vectors in the vector store (knowledge base).
The text data associated with the most similar vector(s) is retrieved and used as the context.
The prompt template is applied to the retrieved context and the user's question to create the final prompt for the language model.
The language model generates an answer based on this prompt, which includes the relevant context and the original question.

So, the 'context' is dynamically retrieved from the knowledge base using vector similarity search, based on the user's input question. This context is then combined with the question in the prompt template and provided to the language model for generating the answer.
By using a vector store and retriever, the system can efficiently search through a large knowledge base and retrieve the most relevant information to augment the language model's response, making it more factual and grounded in the provided context.
